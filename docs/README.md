Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) is an algorithm that generates a one-time password based on the current time. TOTP is an extension of the HMAC-based One-Time Password (HOTP) algorithm and is standardized in RFC 6238. For more details, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-Time_Password).

## Installation

You can install `gen-totp` via npm or yarn:

```bash
npm install gen-totp
# or
yarn add gen-totp
```

## Usage
### Basic Usage
```ts
const genTOTP = require('gen-totp');

const otp = genTOTP('test-key');
// Returns a 6-digit OTP by default
console.log(otp);
```

### Customizing OTP Length

```ts
const genTOTP = require('gen-totp');

const otp = genTOTP('test-key', { digits: 4 });
// Returns a 4-digit OTP
console.log(otp);
```

## Options
The genTOTP function accepts two parameters:

1. `key`: A string containing the base32-encoded secret key. It can include numbers, uppercase letters, `_`, and `-`.
2. `options`: An optional object to customize the OTP generation. The available `options` are detailed in the table below:

| Option     | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                      |
|------------|--------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `digits`    | number | 6       | The number of digits in the generated OTP.                                                      |
| `period`    | number | 30      | The time period (in seconds) after which a new OTP is generated.                                |
| `algorithm` | string | 'SHA-1' | The hashing algorithm used to generate the OTP. Supported algorithms include:                  |
|            |        |         | - `SHA-1`                                                                                       |
|            |        |         | - `SHA-224`                                                                                     |

|            |        |         | - `SHA3-224`                                                                                   |

### Key Format and Allowed Characters

When providing a key to the `genTOTP` function, please ensure the key adheres to the following format:

1. **Allowed Characters**:
   - **Alphabetic Characters**: 
     - Both **uppercase** (`A-Z`) and **lowercase** (`a-z`) English letters are supported.
   - **Numeric Characters**:
     - Digits from `0-9` are allowed.
   - **Special Characters**:
     - The following special characters are accepted: `-_~!@#$%^&*()+.`
   - **Unicode Characters**:
     - Non-English Unicode characters (such as `ä½ `, `Ã©`, etc.) and even emoji (ðŸ˜Š) are supported.

2. **Notes**:
   - **Length**: There is no specific length restriction for the key, but it should be chosen wisely for security purposes.
   - The key is case-sensitive, meaning `A` and `a` are treated as different characters.
   - The key can contain a combination of any of the above characters.
  
### Example of Valid Keys:

- `mySecureKey123!`
- `A1B2C3D4_5678~`
- `secretKeyä½ !@#`
- `emojiKeyðŸ˜ŠðŸ”‘`

**Important**: Ensure your key contains only valid characters from the above categories to avoid errors or invalid key issues.
